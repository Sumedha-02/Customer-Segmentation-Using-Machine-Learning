# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

> A machine learning project to segment customers for targeted marketing strategies.


## About

Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy in marketing that involves categorizing customers into groups based on shared characteristics. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and cluster them into distinct segments for more effective marketing campaigns.


## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the customer data for analysis.
- Feature Selection: Identified relevant features to be used for segmentation.
- Machine Learning Models: Utilized clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) for customer segmentation.
- Visualizations: Created visualizations to illustrate the different customer segments.
- Interpretation: Analyzed and interpreted the characteristics of each customer segment.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)
- Data Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy


## Setup

Describe the steps to set up the project locally. Include code examples and dependencies installation instructions.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sumedha-02/Customer-Segmentation-Using-Machine-Learning.git
cd customer-segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
